note: a[n] mean n'th bit of a (start from 0,1,2,...)
arduino -> computer
a=0b00000000
type=a>>5
state of irsensor: 0b000
state of flamesensor: 0b001
state of keypad: 0b011
computer -> arduino
change state of led: 0b000
- a[n]==1 -> turn (n+1) 'th led on (n mean 0 or 1)
change state of servo: 0b001
- if a[4]==1 mean turn servo on
- else if a[4]==0 mean turn servo off
- a[n]==1 -> turn (n+1) 'th servo on or off depend on a[4] (n mean 0,1 or 2)
